=== Version 1.8
1) The code is revised extensively

2) More options for automatic plots are added:
- '-l' : make plots without tie-lines or dashed grid lines
- '-s' : show hull points as square
- '-a' : fill the hull points with the actual color (i.e., distance from hull or form. energy) instead of the default white inner color
- '-n' : remove all formatting from the hull points (i.e., no customized shape or highlighted edge, with their actual color)

3) Version 1.8.1: added '-u' option
4) Version 1.8.2: internal code-changes: no new feature
